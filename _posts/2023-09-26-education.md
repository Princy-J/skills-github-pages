“Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it.” – Albert Einstein

This quote emphasizes a very important point which is that wisdom cannot be taught in schools; it can only be acquired with life experience. We, as a parent, teachers, or children, tend to ignore this. This quote has another connotation that implies that continuous learning is something that is required to be successful in any field.
